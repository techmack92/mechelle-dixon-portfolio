# Me'Chelle Dixon's Portfolio

## Desciption

The purpose of this application is to showcase the web development skills and concepts that I have acquired throughout coding bootcamp and continued education.</br>
This application includes links to completed projects and snippets of current works-in-progress while highlighting my strengths in HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.</br>
This portfolio is designed to stand out to potential employers and clients alike.</br>

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
